Questions

1.

	A: `sort` outputted the same code in the file but in alphabetical order with `case "cat":` at the top and `//write out data` at the bottom.
	`wc` counted all the new lines, words and bytes in the file, for commands.js it outputted `43  105  1017`
	`uniq` listed all the unique code in the file and anything repeated was removed from the output. This did nothing except remove any code because there were no repeated lines. 

2.

	A: I used `uniq commands.js | wc` It returned the same word count as normal because there were not any removed lines of code by the `uniq` command

function reverseString(inputString) {
 var arr = inputString.split(' ');
 var arrPush = [];
 arr.forEach((el)=>{
 	var word;
 	word = el.split('').reverse().join('');
 	arrPush.push(word);
 })
return arrPush.join(' ');
}
